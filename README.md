To run a part of the code corelating to the assignment simply run the below command from the MachineLearning Folder:

./run.sh {arg}

Here is the list of args and what they corelate to:

0 - 2.2.a - AdaBoost

1 - 2.2.b - Bagged Trees

2 - 2.2.c - Bagged Trees Bias/Var

3 - 2.2.d - Random Forests

4 - 2.2.e - Random Forests Bias/Var

5 - 2.4.a - Batch Gradient Decent

6 - 2.4.b - Stochastic Gradient Decent

Note that some of these can take many hours to run.
